Grammar:

         
###############################################################################
For this project, it inlcudes parsing, typechecking, intermediate code generation
and optimization using graph coloring technique, but assuming no need to spill.
 
This project assume array will either be one or two dimension, and method will have at
most 4 arguments.
 
P5_with_optimiztion: doesn't deal with array. 
 
P5_without_optimization: implement all grammar rules but with many ldr str instruction.
